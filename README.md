## Description

This to-do list maker allows you to list all of the things you need to do, mark them as done, hide already done tasks or even delete them if needed. You can filter your tasks using a search bar right over the task list. Thanks to the async function you can also download example tasks. Here's a little taste of what it looks like:

Project was created with technologies such as:
* BEM
* Flexbox
* Grid
* ES6+ features
* Create React App (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, PostCSS, CSS Loader & Style Loader)
* Custom hooks
* Styled components
* React-Redux
* Redux-Saga
* Redux-toolkit
* React-Router

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
